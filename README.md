# ObstacleDodge (Prototype)

A Unity-based prototype where the player navigates through an obstacle course filled with various dynamic obstacles. 
The objective is to avoid collisions and reach the end of the course with as few hits as possible.

## Game Description

In this prototype, you control a player character through an obstacle course with various challenging elements, including flying, rotating, and falling objects. 
The goal is to avoid these obstacles and reach the target while minimizing the number of collisions. 
Each time the player collides with an obstacle, the obstacle changes color, and a hit is recorded. The total number of hits is displayed in the console as the player’s score once they reach the goal.

## Controls

- **W, A, S, D** – Move the player character forward, left, backward, and right

## Features

- **Dynamic Obstacles** – Includes flying, rotating, and falling objects to increase difficulty
- **Collision Feedback** – Obstacles change color upon collision with the player
- **Score Tracking** – Console logs the number of collisions as the player’s score when the goal is reached
